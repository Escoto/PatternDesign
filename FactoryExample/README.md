# Factory Pattern
Practicing by example the factory pattern with a Pizza Store simulator.

## NOTES

**The Factory Pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES

* Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
