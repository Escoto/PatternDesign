# Decorator Pattern
Practicing by example the decorator pattern with a Coffee Shop (Starbuzz) simulator.

## NOTES

**The Decorator Pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES

* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
