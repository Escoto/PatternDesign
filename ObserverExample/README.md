# The Observer Pattern
Practicing by example the Observer pattern with a weather simulator.

## NOTES

**The Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES

* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
