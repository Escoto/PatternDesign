# Strategy Pattern / Decoupling Behaviors  /  Encapsulated Behaviors
I created this library to practice how to separating what changes from what stays the same.

## NOTES

The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
