# Decoupling Behaviors  /  encapsulated behaviors
I created this library to practice how to separating what changes from what stays the same.

## NOTES

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES

-Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
-Program to an interface, not an implementation.
-Favor composition over inheritance.
