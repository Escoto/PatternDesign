# Pattern Design Practice

I created this solution to practice and learn more about pattern design

## Getting Started

Main is inside [PatternsExamples](https://github.com/Escoto/PatternDesign/tree/master/PatternsExamples) in the [Root.cs](https://github.com/Escoto/PatternDesign/blob/master/PatternsExamples/Root.cs) file.

There is one library project for each pattern.

## APPLIED DESIGN PRINCIPLES

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* **Dependency Inversion** depend upon abstractions, not upon concrete classes.
