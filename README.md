# Pattern Design Practice

## Description
I created this solution to practice and learn more about pattern design

Main is inside [PatternsExamples](https://github.com/Escoto/PatternDesign/tree/master/PatternsExamples)

### LEARNED DESIGN PRINCIPLES

* Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
* Program to an interface, not an implementation.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
