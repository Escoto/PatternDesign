# Factory Pattern
Practicing by example the singleton pattern with a chocolate factory simulator.

## NOTES

**The Singleton Pattern** ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

In some languages, **the gabage collector** can be an issue *(JVM earlier than 1.2 for example)*
